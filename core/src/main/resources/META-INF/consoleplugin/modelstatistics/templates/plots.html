        <h2>Writing expressions</h2>
        An expression filters the list of resource models. It allows finding models with specific performance characteristics. For instance, <span class="expressionExample">mappings > instantiations</span>
        finds models causing more than one subsequent resource to model mapping when instantiated. The query <span class="expressionExample">averageMappingDuration > average(averageMappingDuration)</span>
        finds resource models who's individual average mapping duration is higher than the average mapping duration of all resource models. All properties, except when enclosed in entire(...) or average(...), apply
        to the <em>individual</em> model. For instance, <span class="expressionExample">mappingDurationMedian < averageMappingDuration</span> translates to "find models who's mapping duration median is less than it's average mapping duration".
        One can also employ sub clauses and arithmetic expressions. For instance, <span class="expressionExample">totalMappingDuration > entire(totalMappingDuration) * 0.05</span> finds models that are responsible for more than 5% of the entire mapping time.

        <h2>The model visualization</h2>
        The models are ordered by their total mapping time (totalMappingDuration). Each graph exhibits the following dimensions;
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <tr><th>Instantiations</th><td>The number of times the model was instantiated</td></tr>
                <tr><th>Cache hits</th><td>The number of times the model was loaded from a resource model cache, for instance the default NEBA request-scoped resource model cache.</td></tr>
                <tr><th>Subsequent mappings</th><td>The total number of resource to model mappings initiated by a resource model, i.e. the subsequently used resource models.</td></tr>
                <tr><th>&#x00D8; duration</th><td>The average duration of one resource to model mapping for this type</td></tr>
                <tr><th>median</th><td>The median duration of one resource to model mapping for this type</td></tr>
                <tr><th>Lazy fields</th><td>The number of lazy fields (Optional fields or lazy-loading collections) of this resource model</td></tr>
                <tr><th>Greedy fields</th><td>The number of non-lazy fields (neither Optional nor lazy-loading collections) of this resource model</td></tr>
                <tr><th>Total time</th><td>The total time spent mapping this model</td></tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
