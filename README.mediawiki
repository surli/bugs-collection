== What is BlackLab? ==

[http://inl.github.io/BlackLab/ BlackLab] is a corpus retrieval engine built on top of [http://lucene.apache.org/ Apache Lucene]. It allows fast, complex searches with accurate hit highlighting on large, tagged and annotated, bodies of text. It was developed at the Institute of Dutch Lexicology (INL) to provide a fast and feature-rich search
interface on our historical and contemporary text corpora.

We're also working on BlackLab Server, a web service interface to BlackLab, so you can access it from any programming language. BlackLab Server is included in the repository as well.

BlackLab and BlackLab Server are licensed under the [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 Apache License 2.0].
