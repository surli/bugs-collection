/**
 * The British Julian-Gregorian cutover calendar system.
 * <p>
 * The British calendar system follows the rules of the Julian calendar
 * until 1752 and the rules of the Gregorian (ISO) calendar since then.
 * The Julian differs from the Gregorian only in terms of the leap year rule.
 * <p>
 * The Julian and Gregorian calendar systems are linked to Rome and the Vatican
 * with the Julian preceding the Gregorian. The Gregorian was introduced to
 * handle the drift of the seasons through the year due to the inaccurate
 * Julian leap year rules. When first introduced by the Vatican in 1582,
 * the cutover resulted in a "gap" of 10 days.
 * <p>
 * While the calendar was introduced in 1582, it was not adopted everywhere.
 * Britain did not adopt it until the 1752, when Wednesday 2nd September 1752
 * was followed by Thursday 14th September 1752.
 * <p>
 * This chronology implements the proleptic Julian calendar system followed by
 * the proleptic Gregorian calendar system (identical to the ISO calendar system).
 * Dates are aligned such that {@code 0001-01-01 (British)} is {@code 0000-12-30 (ISO)}.
 * <p>
 * This class implements a calendar where January 1st is the start of the year.
 * The history of the start of the year is complex and using the current standard
 * is the most consistent.
 * <p>
 * The eras of this calendar system are defined by {@link JulianEra} to avoid unnecessary duplication.
 * <p>
 * The fields are defined as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>era - There are two eras, the current 'Anno Domini' (AD) and the previous era 'Before Christ' (BC).
 * <li>year-of-era - The year-of-era for the current era increases uniformly from the epoch at year one.
 *  For the previous era the year increases from one as time goes backwards.
 * <li>proleptic-year - The proleptic year is the same as the year-of-era for the
 *  current era. For the previous era, years have zero, then negative values.
 * <li>month-of-year - There are 12 months in a year, numbered from 1 to 12.
 * <li>day-of-month - There are between 28 and 31 days in each month, numbered from 1 to 31.
 *  Months 4, 6, 9 and 11 have 30 days, Months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 12 have 31 days.
 *  Month 2 has 28 days, or 29 in a leap year.
 *  The cutover month, September 1752, has a value range from 1 to 30, but a length of 19.
 * <li>day-of-year - There are 365 days in a standard year and 366 in a leap year.
 *  The days are numbered from 1 to 365 or 1 to 366.
 *  The cutover year 1752 has values from 1 to 355 and a length of 355 days.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Requirements</h3>
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
