/**
 * Defers all stream events until an <i>end-record</i> is received. Once the
 * event is received {@code StreamDeferrer} forwards all events it has received
 * before the <i>end-record</i> event to the next downstream module. The
 * <i>end-record</i> event is forwarded immediately.
 * <p>
 * The {@code StreamDeferrer} is useful when merging two or more streams of
 * events into one. The module is intended to be added at the end of each flow.
 * There it ensures that the events for each record are forwarded consecutively
 * to the merged flow without them being mixed with events belonging to a record
 * from another stream.
