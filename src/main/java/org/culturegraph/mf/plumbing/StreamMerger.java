/**
 * Merges records based on their id. The module compares the id
 * of each record it receives with the one of previous record; if
 * both records have got the same id, then the end-record and
 * start-record events that would normally separate the records
 * are suppressed in the output stream of {@code StreamMerger}.
 * This effectively merges the two records. Of course, this only
 * works if the records which are to be merged follow each other
 * directly.
