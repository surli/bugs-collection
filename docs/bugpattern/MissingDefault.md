The [Google Java Style Guide ยง4.8.4.3][style] requires each switch statement to
includes a `default` statement group, even if it contains no code. Without it,
the reader does not always know whether execution might silently "fall out" of
the entire block, having executed no code within it. This is undesirable for
most of the same reasons silent fall-through is undesirable.

If the unhandled cases should be impossible, add a `default` clause that throws
`AssertionError`:

```java
switch (state) {
  case READY:
    return true;
  case DONE:
    return false;
  default:
    throw new AssertionError("unexpected state: " + state);
}
```

If having execution fall out of the switch is intentional, add a `default`
clause with a comment:

```java
switch (state) {
  case READY:
    return true;
  case DONE:
    return false;
  default:
    // fall out
}
```
