## Changes in `0.9.0`

Check out the [0.9.0 milestone](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/issues?q=milestone%3A0.9.0+is%3Aclosed) to see new features / bugfixes in detail.

### Configuration Changes and Deprecations

- [#1000](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1000) Tweaks to s3UploaderAdditionalFiles 
  - The SingularityExecutor configuration field `s3UploaderAdditionalFiles`, now supports a `directory` field to specify the directory to search for files to upload. However, the default for this directory is now the task directory (created when using SingularityExecutor), previously it was the `logs` directory within the task directory. To mimic previous behavior add a `directory` of `logs` to any existing `s3UploaderAdditionalFiles` settings.
- [#1166](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1166) Change API path "/skipHealthchecks" to "/skip-healthchecks"
  - The API path `/skipHealthchecks` has been renamed to `/skip-healthchecks` to be more consistent with the rest of the api and avoid using camel case in paths. The previous endpoint is deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming release
