/**
 * An asynchronous handler or callback which gets invoked as soon as some data is available when
 * processing an asynchronous response.
 * <br>
 * Callback methods get invoked in the following order:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>{@link #onStatusReceived(HttpResponseStatus)},</li>
 *  <li>{@link #onHeadersReceived(HttpHeaders)},</li>
 *  <li>{@link #onBodyPartReceived(HttpResponseBodyPart)}, which could be invoked multiple times,</li>
 *  <li>{@link #onTrailingHeadersReceived(HttpHeaders)}, which is only invoked if trailing HTTP headers are received</li>
 *  <li>{@link #onCompleted()}, once the response has been fully read.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <br>
 * Returning a {@link AsyncHandler.State#ABORT} from any of those callback methods will interrupt asynchronous response
 * processing, after that only {@link #onCompleted()} is going to be called.
 * <br>
 * AsyncHandler aren't thread safe, hence you should avoid re-using the same instance when doing concurrent requests.
 * As an example, the following may produce unexpected results:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *   AsyncHandler ah = new AsyncHandler() {....};
 *   AsyncHttpClient client = new AsyncHttpClient();
 *   client.prepareGet("http://...").execute(ah);
 *   client.prepareGet("http://...").execute(ah);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * It is recommended to create a new instance instead.
 * 
 * Do NOT perform any blocking operation in there, typically trying to send another request and call get() on its future.
 * There's a chance you might end up in a dead lock.
 * If you really to perform blocking operation, executed it in a different dedicated thread pool.
 *
 * @param <T> Type of object returned by the {@link java.util.concurrent.Future#get}
